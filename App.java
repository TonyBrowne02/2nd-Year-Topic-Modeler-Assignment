         Improving the GUI quality so that it looks better than a very basic GUI (e.g. layout, 
        colour etc).
         Allowing words which appear on the list as common across documents - but which are 
        obviously not informative about the topic – to be added to the stop word list, and the 
        analysis re-run.

        too.
